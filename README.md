# Coffe Machine
JetBrains Academy

What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you donâ€™t have to
make yourself. Itâ€™s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup 
of energy; but first,
we should teach the machine how to do it. In this project,
in this project, i have worked on programming a coffee machine simulator.
The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; 
if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of 
coffee: espresso, cappuccino,
and latte. Since nothingâ€™s for free, it also collects the money.
